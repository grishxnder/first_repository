This is the repository with my files from summercamp - InnoCamp in Kazan, Russia.
It was started in 20.06.21 in the third lesson. The theme of it was "Git/GitHub".
Now, i wanna describe the previous two lessons.
There are the python files with practics in packages, which names are 'LessonN'.
So interesting.
