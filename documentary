Ok, now I am writing about my files.
Two files with practices are situated in Lesson1 and Lesson2 packages.
Wow, first of all, i wanna describe first practice.
    This is about classes architecture. It is showing the Innopolis Rooms access.
    Four types of person have the different level of access. For example, parent of student have access only to act-hall.
    In the other hand, director of Summer-Camp have access to his/her room. It works correct. - I am happy.
The second file is about two types of car.
    Sportcar and lorry. They have own drivers, engines, and company-producers.
